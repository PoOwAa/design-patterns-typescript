# TypeScript design patterns

This repository made for my series of articles about TypeScript design patterns. I'm not a full-time blogger, so new articles won't come at specified intervals, sorry about that.

In the folders, you can find several individual examples, named by the design pattern itself.

## Articles

1. [Design Patterns in TypeScript — Singleton (Part 1 of 5)](https://andyrum.medium.com/design-patterns-in-typescript-singleton-part-1-of-5-bd3742b46589)

More coming soon!

## Issues

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests. I don't promise to keep watching all the time, but I review them every month at least once.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to the project and make it better, your help is very welcome. Contributing is also a great way to learn more about social coding on Github, new technologies and their ecosystems, and how to make constructive, helpful bug reports, feature requests, and the noblest of all contributions: a good, clean pull request!
